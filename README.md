# Bathymetric surface tools
This repository holds bathymetric surface manipulation tools that I developed originally for my Master's thesis (thesis available online, in Finnish only: https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/273488)

This source code includes efficient implementations (written in pure C) of Rolling Coin surface smoothing algorithm (for more information please refer to my thesis) and navigationally safe iterative Laplacian interpolation.

A short English description of the Rolling Coin algorithm is also available online at https://github.com/finnishtransportagency/RollingCoin (see the description of'V2' version)

Dependencies:
  - GDAL library (for file I/O)
